# NASA-Grant-Project-Arduino-Based
Arduino project logic

Thankfully, some rather fantastic people have made code available that made the development of this Arduino project possible in the short time my group had to "tinker" with Arduino programming, circuits, and sensors. This project including the code and physical project was presented at the University of Southern California and developed thanks to the NASA Space Grant, while I was still attending community college.
